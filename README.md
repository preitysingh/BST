# BST

It's pretty self explanatory, but the java class BinarySearchTree creates a binary search tree from scratch. This means that it utilizes Node objects from the Node class and sorts through a collection of elements in a binary method. The left tree of a node contains a key less than the node that has a larger key in the right side of the tree. You will have to have BST.java and Node.java to use this project.
